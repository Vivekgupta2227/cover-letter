  \noindent Dear recruiter,

These years at university has sparked my interest in more complex part of Computer Science. I believe in the important weight that has these with you and would be excited to be an intern with your organization.

  During the last year of college I discover that really like data analysis, ie, big data, cryptography, optimization methods, advanced algorithms and all related with study, find and coding the better method to solve any kind of problem. I intend to graduate on third quater of 2016 and I'm looking for experience that is applicable to my yield.

  \paragraph{}
